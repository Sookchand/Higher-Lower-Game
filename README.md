#  Higher or Lower {Python Game}
The game in the code is a guessing game where the player has to guess which celebrity has more followers. Here‚Äôs a brief description of how it works:

The game starts by randomly selecting two celebrities from a list of celebrities (the data list). Each celebrity is represented as a dictionary with keys such as ‚Äòname‚Äô, ‚Äòdescription‚Äô, ‚Äòcountry‚Äô, and ‚Äòfollower_count‚Äô.

The game displays the information about the two celebrities to the player. The player has to guess which celebrity has more followers by typing ‚ÄòA‚Äô or ‚ÄòB‚Äô.

The game checks if the player‚Äôs guess is correct. If the guess is correct, the player‚Äôs score is incremented by 1, and the game continues with a new pair of celebrities. If the guess is incorrect, the game displays the final score and exits.

The game keeps running in a loop until the player guesses incorrectly.

This game tests the player‚Äôs knowledge about celebrities and their popularity on social media. It‚Äôs a fun way to learn more about different celebrities while also challenging your intuition and guessing skills.

## Tech Stack
The game in the provided code is developed using Python, which is a popular high-level programming language known for its simplicity and readability. Here are the specific Python features and modules used:

1. **Python's built-in functions**: The game uses several built-in Python functions such as `print()` for displaying messages, `input()` for getting user input, and `exit()` for terminating the program.

2. **Python's random module**: The `choice()` function from Python's `random` module is used to randomly select a celebrity from the list of celebrities.

3. **Python's while loop and if-else statements**: The game logic is controlled using a `while` loop and `if-else` statements. The `while` loop keeps the game running until the user guesses incorrectly, and the `if-else` statements are used to check the user's guess and update the score.

4. **Python's global keyword**: The `global` keyword is used to indicate that the `score` variable is a global variable that can be accessed and modified inside the `check_answer()` function.

5. **Custom Python functions**: The game defines several custom functions such as `get_new_celebrity()`, `format_celebrity()`, and `check_answer()` to organize the code and make it more modular and readable.

6. **Python's string formatting**: The game uses f-strings, a feature introduced in Python 3.6, to embed expressions inside string literals for formatting.

7. **Python's list data structure**: The list of celebrities (`data`) is represented as a list of dictionaries in Python.

8. **Python's dictionary data structure**: Each celebrity is represented as a dictionary with keys such as 'name', 'description', 'country', and 'follower_count'.

Please note that this code also references some external modules (`game_data`, `art`) which are not included in the provided code snippet. These modules contain additional data and functionality used by the game. üòä
